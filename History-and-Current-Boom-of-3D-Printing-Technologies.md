# History and Current Boom of 3D Printing Technologies
==============================================

## Executive Summary
-------------------

The history of 3D printing dates back to the early 1980s when Hideo Kodama first discovered the concept of printing layers of material to create a 3D object. Since then, the technology has evolved significantly, with advancements in materials and processes enabling the production of more complex and durable objects. Today, 3D printing is not only used for prototyping but also for creating functional models and products in various industries such as aerospace, automotive, healthcare, consumer goods, and education.

## Introduction
-------------

Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology has revolutionized the way we create and manufacture objects. From rapid prototyping to functional modeling, 3D printing has become an essential tool in various fields. This paper will delve into the history of 3D printing, its current boom, and possible future usage.

### The Early Years
---------------

The concept of 3D printing dates back to the early 1980s when Hideo Kodama first discovered the idea of printing layers of material to create a 3D object. In 1981, Kodama filed the first patent for 3D printing technology, marking the official inception of this transformative technology.

### The 1990s and Beyond
-------------------

In the 1990s, significant improvements in 3D printing techniques propelled the technology forward. Innovations such as stereolithography (SLA) utilized UV light to cure photopolymer resins, allowing for more complex geometries and finer details in printed objects.

## Current Boom of 3D Printing Technologies
-----------------------------------------

Today, 3D printing is not only used for prototyping but also for creating functional models and products. The technology has advanced significantly, with the introduction of new materials and processes such as fused deposition modeling (FDM), selective laser sintering (SLS), and digital light processing (DLP).

### Industrial Applications
