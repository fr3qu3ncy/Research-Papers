# History and Current Boom of 3D Printing Technologies
==============================================

## Executive Summary
-------------------

The history of 3D printing technologies dates back to the 1980s, with Chuck Hull's invention of stereolithography (SLA) in 1984 marking a significant breakthrough. Since then, 3D printing has evolved rapidly, with various techniques and materials being developed for additive manufacturing. Today, 3D printing is no longer limited to prototyping and research institutions but has become an integral part of various industries such as aerospace, automotive, healthcare, and consumer goods. This report will delve into the history, progress, current usage, possible future usage, and interesting use cases of 3D printing technologies.

## History of 3D Printing Technologies
-------------------------------------

### Early Developments

The concept of additive manufacturing, which underpins all 3D printing technologies, was a revolutionary step away from traditional subtractive manufacturing processes. The first patent related to 3D printing was filed by Dr. Hideo Kodama of Nagoya Municipal Industrial Research Institute in 1980 [1]. This marked the official inception of what would become a transformative technology.

### Key Innovations in the 1980s

The 1980s saw significant breakthroughs in the field of 3D printing. Chuck Hull's invention of SLA in 1984 catalyzed the development of the first commercial 3D printer, which laid the groundwork for future innovations [2]. This process enabled the creation of complex parts layer by layer using a UV laser to solidify photopolymer resin.

Another pivotal advancement was the introduction of Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), which expanded the possibilities of 3D printing to include a wider range of materials, such as nylon and polystyrene [3]. The versatility of SLS opened new doors for industrial applications and custom manufacturing.

### Transition from Prototyping to Functional Models

The transition from using 3D printing solely for prototyping to its application in creating functional models marked a significant milestone in the technology's evolution. Businesses began to recognize the potential of 3D printing in producing end-use parts and products, not just prototypes [4]. This shift was driven by advancements in printer reliability, material properties, and the precision of printed objects.

### Early 2000s: Advancements and Expansion

Between 2002 and 2014 over 200 early 3D printing patents expired. The expiration of the patent on the Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) printing process opened the field for significantly more affordable consumer and hobbyist-focused 3D printers to be developed [5]. The RepRap was one of these early low-cost 3D printers, made primarily from plastic parts.

### Modern Developments

Today, 3D printing has become a mainstream technology with various techniques and materials being used in additive manufacturing. FDM, SLA, SLS, and Digital Light Processing (DLP) are some of the most common methods used in 3D printing [6]. These technologies have enabled the creation of complex geometries and fine details in printed objects.

## Progress and Advancements
---------------------------

### Improved Printing Techniques

The 1990s witnessed significant improvements in 3D printing techniques that propelled the technology forward. Innovations in this era not only enhanced the precision of 3D printers but also allowed for more complex geometries and finer details in printed objects [7]. One of the key advancements was the introduction of SLA, which utilized UV light to cure photopolymer resins.

### New Materials and Techniques

The development of new materials and techniques has been a significant factor in the progress of 3D printing. The use of metal powders, ceramics, glass, and other materials has expanded the possibilities of 3D printing [8]. Techniques such as Selective Laser Melting (SLM), Electronic Beam Melting (EBM), and Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM) have also been developed for additive manufacturing.

## Current Usage
-----------------

### Industrial Applications

Today, 3D printing is used in various industries such as aerospace, automotive, healthcare, and consumer goods. The use of 3D printing has enabled the creation of complex parts and products that were previously impossible or too costly to produce [9]. Companies such as General Electric (GE), Boeing, and Ford have been at the forefront of adopting 3D printing technologies for their manufacturing processes.

### Research and Education

Research institutions and educational institutions have also been using 3D printing for various applications. The use of 3D printing has enabled students and researchers to visualize concepts and create prototypes to test theories in various fields [10].

## Possible Future Usage
---------------------------

### Space Exploration

The use of 3D printing in space exploration is a significant area of interest. NASA has been using 3D printing for the production of spare parts and tools on the International Space Station [11]. The potential of 3D printing in space exploration is vast, with applications in the creation of habitats, spacecraft components, and other infrastructure.

### Personalized Medicine

The use of 3D printing in personalized medicine is another area of interest. Researchers have been using 3D printing to create customized implants, prosthetics, and other medical devices [12]. The potential of 3D printing in personalized medicine is vast, with applications in the creation of customized organs and tissues.

## Interesting Use Cases
-------------------------

### Prosthetic Limbs

The use of 3D printing in the creation of prosthetic limbs has been a significant area of interest. Researchers have been using 3D printing to create customized prosthetics that are tailored to individual patients' needs [13]. The use of 3D printing has enabled the creation of prosthetics that are more comfortable, durable, and effective than traditional prosthetics.

### Customized Implants

The use of 3D printing in the creation of customized implants has been another significant area of interest. Researchers have been using 3D printing to create customized implants that are tailored to individual patients' needs [14]. The use of 3D printing has enabled the creation of implants that are more effective and durable than traditional implants.

## Conclusion
----------

The history and current boom of 3D printing technologies have been significant. From its early developments in the 1980s to its modern applications in various industries, 3D printing has come a long way. The potential of 3D printing is vast, with applications in space exploration, personalized medicine, and other areas.
