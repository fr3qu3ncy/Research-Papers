# The History and Modern Use of Synthesizers
=====================================

## Executive Summary
-------------------

Synthesizers have come a long way since their inception in the early 20th century. From their humble beginnings as experimental instruments to their current status as an integral part of modern music production, synthesizers have played a pivotal role in shaping the sound of contemporary music. This research paper delves into the history and evolution of synthesizers, highlighting their development from simple electronic circuits to sophisticated digital devices that can produce a wide range of sounds.

## History
------------

The concept of synthesizing sound dates back to the late 19th century with the invention of the Telharmonium (or Dynamophone) by Thaddeus Cahill in 1897. This early instrument used rotating tone wheels to generate electrical signals that could be transmitted over telephone lines and converted back into sound at the receiving end. Although it was not a true synthesizer, the Telharmonium laid down the theoretical framework for subsequent synthesizer development.

The first true synthesizers emerged in the 1940s and 1950s with the invention of instruments like the Trautonium and the Electronic Sackbut. These early devices provided detailed control over timbre, envelope, and articulation during performance, establishing the foundational principles for subsequent synthesizer design.

In the 1960s, the introduction of the Moog synthesizer revolutionized music production by providing a versatile instrument that could produce a wide range of sounds. The Moog's popularity led to the development of other influential synthesizers like the Buchla and the Arp.

The 1970s saw the emergence of programmable synthesizers, which further expanded the possibilities of electronic music production. The introduction of digital synthesis in the 1980s marked a significant turning point in the history of synthesizers, enabling them to produce more complex sounds and paving the way for the development of modern software synthesizers.

### Pre-Computing Synthesis
