# The Future of UK Designers
==========================

## Executive Summary
-------------------

This report explores the current state and potential future of designers in the United Kingdom. With a focus on their role, skills, and impact on government services and policies, it discusses the importance of professional designers in addressing complex design problems.

### Current State of Designers in the UK
---------------------------------------

The UK design consultancy sector has been growing steadily since 2015, with the market size increasing from £2.4 billion to £3.8 billion (Cooper, 2020). However, there is a need for professional expert designers who can serve an important function in addressing complex problems that are too big or difficult for amateurs to fix.

### The Role of Designers in Government Services and Policies
---------------------------------------------------------

Designers have a crucial role to play in shaping government services and policies. They bring a unique perspective and set of skills to the policy-making process, enabling them to identify and address user needs more effectively (Salinas & Lagedamont, 2022). The GOV.UK team at GDS has worked with students to explore speculative design techniques for imagining alternative futures, including the creation of fictional services such as a Ministry of Biodiversity.

### Speculative Design Techniques
------------------------------

Speculative design techniques involve exploring preferable, possible, and probable futures to anticipate and proactively engage with possible scenarios (Salinas & Lagedamont, 2022). By using these techniques, designers can identify unintended consequences and ensure that people's needs are met. This approach also reinforces lateral thinking, enabling designers to review current practices and ways of working.

### The Benefits of a Balanced View
----------------------------------

When engaging in speculative design, it is essential to adopt a balanced view of the future, considering both positive and negative scenarios (Salinas & Lagedamont, 2022). This ensures that designers generate helpful ideas and avoid concentrating solely on negative outcomes. By exploring preferable, possible, and probable futures, designers can identify risks society may face and develop strategies to mitigate them.

### Career Pathways for Designers
-------------------------------

Career pathways will enable designers and the practice to continue elevating (Salinas & Lagedamont, 2022). A central core of universal design capabilities will provide consistency across the practice, scalability within governments, and the nurturing of emerging pockets of design. Codified capabilities will make it easier for designers to move around the public sector and hire designers.

### Future Usage
----------------

The future usage of speculative design techniques in the UK is expected to increase as governments seek new holistic ways to measure value beyond traditional accountancy approaches (Salinas & Lagedamont, 2022). By examining outputs and process, governments can aim to deliver a broader set of things like the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.

### Interesting Use Cases
-------------------------

One interesting use case is the creation of fictional services such as a Ministry of Biodiversity. This involved imagining services for reporting sightings of bears, checking times when rivers were closed for fish spawning, and obtaining an apprenticeship and qualification in biodiversity law (Salinas & Lagedamont, 2022).

### Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, designers play a vital role in shaping government services and policies. By adopting speculative design techniques, they can identify and address user needs more effectively. The future usage of these techniques is expected to increase as governments seek new holistic ways to measure value.
